One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other" (Smith). This event happening in a small wooded area of upstate New York was the start of Joseph Smith translating the Book of Mormon, founding the church, and becoming a prophet of the Lord. This was the start of the entire event that we call the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. </p></div>

This process took a long while but when it finally happened Joseph Smith recorded the event saying  “the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate. On the twenty-second day of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven” (Smith). This was a major event for Jospeh as he was then able to attempt to translate the gold plates. This was not easy however, as many men tried to get the plates because of their estimated value. Rumors surrouned the plates saying that they were made of Gold when in fact they were only a golden color.</p></div>

                            <div class="timeline-body"><p class="text-muted">The translation of the gold plates was not a easy endeaver for Jospeh Smith. Not only was translation a struggle for Joseph but also he had people trying to get the plates constantly. One example of this was from the book saints where they exaplain how "while on an errand just over the hill from the Smith home, Joseph Sr. overheard a group of men plotting to steal the gold plates. “We will have the plates,” one of them said, “in spite of Joe Smith or all the devils in hell.”" (Saints). This increased the time it took for Joseph to finish the tranlsation of the plates. It got so bad for him that he had to move frequently and even had to stay at Oliver Cowdrey's friends house David Whitmer. It was at this location that Joseph Smith finished the translation of the plates and it was there that the three and eight witnesses saw the gold plates and testified of the Book of Mormon. In the words of the three witness they say "And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man. And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are true. And it is marvelous in our eyes." (Cowdery,Whitmer,Harris).</p></div>

It was at this time he gave them the keys of the Aaronic Priesthood. It was after this that they bapitzed each other holding the proper authority. </p></div>

The reason that it took so long was because Joseph and others had to find the right publisher. Someone that would take care of the manuscript and give them a fair price for the printing of such a large book. After they found John H Gilbert, a very well known and skillful publisher it took even longer because Joshep and Hyrum Smith did not want any more of the manuscript to be lost. This led them to create a new manuscript so that they could have the original and Gilbert could have a copy. After this manuscript was made Gilbert went about printing the book. In his own words he says "I punctuated it to make it read as I supposed the Author intended, and but very little punctuation was altered in proofreading" (Gilbert). After Gilbert was publishing this book many members and people around the world read and came to know that the Book of Mormon is the Word of God. This process continues today and if you want to know the truthfulness of the book read it for yourself. You can request a free copy in the yellow circle below!  </p></div>

                            <p class="">Prophet</p>
                           <p class = "text-muted">Joseph Smith started his journey in very humble beginnings as he was a simple farm boy trying to ask one question which church was true. This question lead him to the sacred grove where he got down and prayed during his prayer he said that “I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true. . ..I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation” (Smith) . This would lead to him discovering the Book of Mormon and he translated it using seer stones. This led to many other encounters with people both who loved what he was doing and despised him for his actions. After the printing of the Book of Mormon, he would go on to found the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and eventually, this led to his death while he was in jail. Everything Joseph did in his life was because of his calling a prophet of God and if you want to know if he was really a prophet of God do as he did and pray to heavenly father and he will tell you the truth of all things. </p>

                                Before Joseph received the Book of Mormon or realized his full role as a prophet of God Emma was standing beside him believing in him and supporting him in whatever situation she needed to. This was evident in Emma’s person when she was called upon by the lord to help Joseph in receiving the Golden Plates. Emma would later go on to do many important things for Joseph and for the church. The first and arguably most important however was when she was scribing for Joseph as the first scribe helping him translate and put into writing the Book of Mormon. While Emma did many things in her life including becoming the first relief society president and helping the saints move to Nauvoo, her lifelong devotion to Joseph and the Book of Mormon was the most important role she could play in the restoration and was second to none in bringing about the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

                                Oliver Cowdrey before meeting Joseph Smith and helping him as a scribe for the Book of Mormon was a schoolteacher. After teaching for a long time in the area where Joseph’s family live Oliver recounts how he had a vision from the Lord where he says that the Lord “Shewed unto me a heavenly vision for behold an angel of the Lord came and stood before me and it was by night and he called me by name and he said the Lord had forgiven me my sins and he revealed unto me that in the Town of Manchester Ontario County N.Y. there was plates of gold upon which there was engravings which was engraven by Maroni & his fathers the servants” (Cowdery). This is a snippet from Oliver Cowdrey’s own journal entry where he explains the first time, he decided he was going to help further the lord’s work. After this vision, he accomplished just that when he became the main scribe for Joseph Smith as he was translating the Book of Mormon. This wasn’t all he did, however, as he also become one of the three witnesses to see the Book of Mormon. This would not last forever when after a rough period for the saints Oliver would eventually fall away from the Church. However, he never did revoke his testimony of the Book of Mormon.

Oliver later asked David if he would allow Joseph and him to stay at his home to finish the Book of Mormon away from those giving them trouble. At first, David wasn’t going to be able to let them stay at this home but after a miracle occurred, he and his family decided to let Joseph and Oliver stay at their house. This kind gesture allowed joseph to finish the Book of Mormon and David Whitmer would later become one of the three witnesses of the Book of Mormon. </p>

                            <p class="">Financier/Witness for The Book of Mormon </p>
                            <p class ="text-muted">Martin Harris was a man who lived in Palmyra New York and who had built himself some wealth from his large farm and his industrial nature. During this time that Martin was enjoying a comfortable life, he was visited by Lucy Smith, Joseph’s mother, during this visit Martin would hear about the vision that Joseph had. This intrigued Martin and would lead to him becoming the main source of income for Joseph as he translated the Book of Mormon. Martin Harris would later also become one of the three witnesses to be able to see the gold plates for himself. However, Martin’s experience with the church and Joseph was not always good. During the translation of the Book of Mormon Martin begged Joseph to let him take a manuscript away to show his wife and prove to her the truth of this work. However, during the transit to his home to show his wife the manuscript which was over 100 pages large was lost. This caused tension between Joseph and Martin but was able to be worked out as the book of Mormon neared completion. </p>

                            <p class="text-muted">Moroni before becoming an angel of Heavenly Father, Moroni was the last prophet to write in the Book of Mormon. This led him to later reveal the place where he hid the plates to Joseph Smith. However, the time between Joseph receiving the plates and the First Vision was over 3 years. During this time Moroni taught Joseph important lessons about Heavenly Father and Josephs’s role in his plan.  </p>

                                    <p>The book of Mormon is the word of God given to his prophets in the Americas. This book not only contains revelation that they receive but since the people of the Americas were a tribe of Israel it also contains revelation given to Old testimate prophets. In a reasearch paper by Fredrick Nicholas he says "One of the most noticeable aspects of the Book of Mormon is its integration of the King James Bible into its own text"(Nicholas). This is true as the book of Mormon is a continuation of the Bible and it is not ment to replace or dismiss the revelation of any of the lords prophets. In another article by Rebeccas Roesler she says that "Acquisition of spiritual knowledge is instead represented as a dynamic process of development and, at times, decay"(Roesler). This is exactly what happened in the Book of Mormon and in our lives today their are times of dynamic development and their are times of decay it all depends on if we are doing the things that will bring us closer to God. The Book of Mormon brings us closer to God and it helps us to build a strong foundation on Jesus Christ.

                                    <p>In a quite wooded area in upstate New York Joseph knelt down and prayed and asked God which church he should join. It was at this moment a blinding light appeared to him and he witnessed Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ appear to him in a vision. They told him that none of the churches were completely true and that he would be a prophet to bring back the lords true church. This was a moment that Josephs life changed forever and many historians pick this moment as being the start of his prophetic role. In a discourse by Steven Harper and Ann Tayes Miss Tays states that "the first revelatory event that framed all subsequent ones. He always led with it, whether in his 1832 or 1839 autobiographies or in his 1835 story about the circumstances that produced the Book of Mormon. His story began there"(Tayes). This is so true the story of the first vision was the starting point for Josephs rise as a prophet and eventual death. However, some people question this event by asking why Joseph told this story so many different ways as their is multiple accounts of this vision. The answer to that question is simple their are so many different accounts of the first vision because each account is told to a different group of people. Many historians have said that this was most likely Joseph highlighting different parts for different groups of people and to tell them the parts they needed to hear.  </p>
